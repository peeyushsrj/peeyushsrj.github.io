If you're like me , getting 2-3 spam calls daily average. Sometimes, it's around 5-7 also! Then there's an application to detect calls.


**Problem Statement** -  Detect a spam, before it comes

**tldr** : Use Truecaller

Although it reads, all your contacts and call records etc. But surely, this would tell you upfront spam or not! Thus, you save time with money (for their premium non adv. version)

Somewhat like below!
