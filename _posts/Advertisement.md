Advertisements
==============

Advertisement has one of the things that doomed generation and continue to do so.

Right now people has way of spoting and throwing Advertisement. For your proof ,

ask any adult about Advertisement. he will tell you!

## Indirect Advertisement

has been known for some for some time, like in movies etc. using guchi bag etc. 
And that has been working okay, celebrities wearing their favourites, not in Advertisement.

(Advertisement looks lame! from people that don't know anything about it!)

In that case reviews by professional always works. For that you have to be professional! 
Being a professional, is being known to multiple aduience, I can't say a number, beacuse 
I haven't reach it! (around 1000 people)

Another way would be for professional, to try out random things - like singer pruchainsg 
a keyboard and saying worth. that is subcousous hit! trust me i got it and i purchased.
afterall all the marketing industry is all about hacking your intuition. How?

SHowing you adds for things that you can purchase more, based on a criteria,
until the moment that celebrity or a human recommends that thing out - and shot!

Engineers earn themselves and system! That's real money making machine. 
(what are you doing?)

Any cons!? 

Afterall most business are zero sum games, (trying to rule people or country)
you can't say it's doing an evil - afterall they are necessary devil. 
I am assuming you're only buying from a platform once purchase is down.

I think it's best way for me to advertize! Although I don't play unfair games, 
my program is open-source and self hosted. Want to purhcase  a product when
price go below certain point from amazon.in ( if you're so concerned wiht pricayc use self hosted.)
