Have you observed, sometimes that you wanted to play the guitar chords but not able to keep up with singing? 

After trying to resume my music, via guitar I been facing same problems. You know, playing after 9 years - one tend to forget many stuffs! So, I been forcing myself to play on the guitarchords on the internet! And my singing can't catchup. Another worse part, is I can't sing those high Scales in F, G. If any song switches from A to G - god bless me. 

Then, based on the music theory I tried to learn from the GPT. That, you can always shift and transpose these notes. And I suddenly remember that's why I used to put a bar to change the scales back in college (mostly it was my old friend he suggests). 

Transposing can make you sing and play together! Use bar to shift based on Transposing. Even if you don't try shifting scales to align your scale along with the progression.
