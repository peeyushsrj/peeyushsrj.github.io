## Problem

Shopping and reminder is cucumber-some, if something is urgent we will buy it. But with more busyness in life, we may miss something that is not urgent or that is not important. 

Only import & urgent once, we do usually on demand. How does your family members, make sure that you don't miss any items?

## Solution

> *Alexa, add it to shopping list!*


Yes, that's it. We have Alexa installed in each our mobile handsets. We ask Alexa, what's is in shopping list. 

With one tap of mobile, 

> Alexa, add shampoo to grocery list!

With one tap of mobile, 

> Alexa, read grocery list!

> Alexa, mark item shampoo in my grocery list!

And , it's out of shopping list. So whenever any family member of us, goes out. We use mostly Alexa! (including my mom)

**P.S.** Well most of us!
