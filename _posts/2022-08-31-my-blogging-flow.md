### Introduction

If you want to do self hosted, and maintain self without any third parties. You should have this workflow due to following reasons 

- **Easy updatation**: Write text file with markdown (syntax highligting) and update your blog with single click. 
- **Platform Independent**: Laptop not available, no worrries! Use another laptop, or use mobile . Configure , updated and push! 
- **Quick Theming & Customization**: 10000+ themes available, plus if you know basic css and html. then you can configure your own theme.
- **Schedule Posts**: Yes, to the exact time and date. You can keep writing in local system and publish. But to world it's going to show at the certains times. But it's bit one time setup.
- **Newsletter**: Same one time configuration with mailerlite and you're set! 
- **No Downtime**: Yes, your blog never goes down. As the proability of github going down is very rare (as they have multiple datacenters region wise)
- **Audience:** Yes, you can enable disqus plugin here, and enable comments on your posts with one quick setting.  
- **FREE**: Yes, it's free of cost, except when you buy a domain. Which you should. Your files will go to github. Cons, they can read the file (free perks disadvantage)!
- **Forever**: Your data is not in your laptop, it's on cloud. So your hardisk may crash, but data will be there always on github. (Well until github runs, but you can export and push to other platforms as well like Gitlab)
- **Issue Tracker**:  You wanted to track , your blog? You don't need to go to other platform. Use github issues along with Kanban Github boards to schedule this as well. Assign different people , different issues as well. 
- **Multiple People Working**: If you know about Github Pull Request, then basically you can allow 100 people to work on your blog. And they handle all of this using separate branch and merge. (obviously you need to manage order of priority of posts and brannces) No more conflicts, easy for multiple people working on it.
- **Draft mode**: You can turn off one setting in your post, and bam it's hidden! Keep multiple things hidden from world. Launch with a setting switch.

Finally it's what you are and what your values and what's your small point in the world. You can be best at single point! Blog enables you to do this, another is it's much valuable than instragram. (except when you're influencer)

> Think yourself over a minute, would you see those photos. Or you see towards the end, what you have contributed to the world!

## Process

1. [Github Account](https://github.com/) for platform login and signup. You can then follow on how to setup a blog with [Generating static jekyll site on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
2. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is used to pull cloud date to local site to edit.
3. [Obsedian](https://obsidian.md/) another good tool, to organise thy notes and write it well. It has so many plugins for writers as well as programmers. Once you're done you can use Github Desktop to push back to cloud. (yes it's autosave!)

This is rought, but if you want to get in depth. You defintely **need one time support**, feel free to DM. I know few people, who can enable a platform for you to do this seemless! ðŸ˜Œ
