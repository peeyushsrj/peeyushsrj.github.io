I found these primary game changing feature, that is relieving!

1. Choose from whom to receive mail (Screening)

Screening is a place where you can select, which mails to go to `Imbox`. This is powerful, as you don't want 1000 promotional mails to go into inbox and then clicking unsusbribe. This one click saves the trouble!

3. Choose where to keep them

`Imbox` is your primary important mails.
`Feed` is all promotional or newsletter mails. All weekly and daily things aggregates here.
`PaperTrail` is where one can keep all transactional mails! Helpful for cryto or invoice trackings.

3. Reply Later

You can mark an email to reply later. It will be shown on side, every time you open mail box. Reminds for action! 

5. Spam Filter

They have some good spam algorithm. You can move out any mails from or into here!

4. Clean Interface for focus typing mail

5. Upcoming Email to newsletter solution
 
It's a good place to source out your notes/learning/discoveries/results to the world, just an email away. (world is your subscriber's)

Look at common ones -
