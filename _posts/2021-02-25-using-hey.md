I found these primary game changing features, that are relieving!

1. Choose from whom to receive mail (Screening)<br>
Screening is a place where you can select which emails to go to Imbox. This is powerful, as you don't want 1000 promotional mails to go into inbox and then clicking unsubscribe. This one click saves the trouble!
 
2. Choose where to keep them (categories)<br>
Imbox is your primary important mail. Feed is all promotional or newsletter mails. All weekly and daily things aggregate here. PaperTrail is where one can keep all transactional mails! Helpful for crypto or invoice trackings.

3. Reply Later<br>
You can mark an email to reply later. It will be shown on the side, every time you open the mailbox. Reminds for action!

4. Spam Filter<br>
They have some good spam algorithms. You can move out any mails from or into here! Along with **blocking email trackers and blocking advertisments**.

5. Clean Interface for focus typing mail<br>

Also not to forget their, **Upcoming Email to newsletter solution**

It's a good place to source out your notes/learning/discoveries/results to the world, just an email away. e.g. [Jason's blog](http://world.hey.com/jason)

[Sign up](https://app.hey.com/sign_up) is just a minute away!
