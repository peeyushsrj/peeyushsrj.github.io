## PROS

1. Choose from whom to receive mail (Screening)<br>
Screening is a place where you can select which emails to go to Imbox. This is powerful, as you don't want 1000 promotional mails to go into inbox and then clicking unsubscribe. This one click saves the trouble!
 
2. Choose where to keep them (categories)<br>
Imbox is your primary important mail. Feed is all promotional or newsletter mails. All weekly and daily things aggregate here. PaperTrail is where one can keep all transactional mails! Helpful for crypto or invoice trackings.

3. Reply Later<br>
You can mark an email to reply later. It will be shown on the side, every time you open the mailbox. Reminds for action!

4. Grouping via email provider

### CONS

1. News feed is too overwhelming. It's like facebook food. But problem with this is important unread ones ; can go to the bottom. It would be better if they give simple read and unread mail interface at Feed also.
