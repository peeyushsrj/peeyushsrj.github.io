classic solution is to do opposite. but how, when there are lot of different input situaltions 
are fed in; resultsing in our different environment and situation.

but problem occurs in thinking about situations, not moving out phsical things etc. 

what are some examples and use cases:-

1. Why do poor remains, poor?
2. Why do are we stuck into working class?
3. Why low page working for long time, rather than rich liferstyle?


Because poor think, that this is the realtiyt. they are settled with it.
they don't try to reject, or look for better one. Problme is they are okay, 
with their employers for giving them low wages! 

This is the problem for poor, not for rich. Cause we are using most important resource in the world, CHEAP LABOUR. 
(No suprise, so many companies exists! XD)

And lot of people are stuck in that zone for long.

Thus, changing mindset is the most important thing. 

> problem is we don't have single aim. we have lots of discrented - @naval

so instead make a list of things you want to have or experience; 

(This comes under subset of neopolian's laws of success.)

2. have extra confidence in your ability of acheive . (not being in stuck state)

3. take initaites are very important and followed by leadershpo to inspire people, for feedback loop.

4. IMAGNIATION (that needs to be written and so not) 

Action items :-

1. Identiyf which parts do you really want, and couldn't get it.
2. Get it with money, if easily
3. Get it with time, if easily.
4. high order thinking skills

or break free as beingbrae (don't note anythng there written over here thien)
