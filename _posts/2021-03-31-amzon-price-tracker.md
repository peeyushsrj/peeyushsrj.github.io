### Problem

**tldr**: This is for non urgent items only.

Amazon is great for us, as we get what we want with a click of a button (of few clicks). Well problem is that price varies, and sometimes we missed the offers. It's cumbersome also to subscribe to those discount channels, and f**king look for all item. Nope, we want to limit ourself for that item's discount. Now how would you do that? 

### Solution

**AIM:** This utility helps you to alert when a price goes down for a certain item on amazon. You can simply paste `url`, `buy_below` price and `email` to which alert needs to be sent! 

This application can be accessible via this [Google form](https://forms.gle/KbYSJnFPHGvKAZzQ7).

If you want to self host the code (run the  code by yourself). Use the following [repository](https://bitbucket.org/peeyushsrj/amzsc/src/master/), to build the docker imiage and self host.

*Note - you will continuously receive emails every hour; if the price goes down below the price.
