It's a quality of a life, where a person aims to live happier by desiging an optimum life 
for driving him to his/her destinty. (or say a life)

I can have one of the assumption, if you're life is miserable or you want to know the secret! Continue.

I don't know about poor people, but middle class people are those who spend their life earning credits by 
trading their time. Some one buy them to save their own most important resource; time. These people go on life,
adjusting and always money limit in the mind. They are never free, until they be serious to be! 
If you want to dig deeper continue, otherwise focus on earning enough credits to reach here! 
(Yes, it needs time and smart hard work!)

> Let's come down to core of a lifestyle, that is a decision making.

Q. What should be an important decision? 

The one where you are happy the most. 

Assume, you have all the credit in your life. How will you going to live?

Will you take that bike now?

Will you marry that person now?

Will you eat that thing now?

Will you live that way now?

Will you work in that place now?


Overall, all these factors - which you can say pillars of your life come to terms, to **maximze happines**.
And it will be , when you know what is happines to you? everyone has been conditioned with them,
in their own unique way. I will say try completing those desires, just to see what is beyond! 

So am I!

Q. Do you think financial independece will be a joke in year say 2060, and our generation will be looked as a fool earning credits?
