> Order of good relationship is no. of stones thrown and picked by partners - like a friendly football game! 

<!--Personally, I don't throwing any stones, I am just avoiding to get hit. fuck me! This is a brutal process of self and other self discovery - and I been playing defensive bad - like I did in school. (A fast hit can kill me anytime) -->

That means, friendship is core for any relationship along with other benefits! 

Now the stones, refers to the mental situations both parties throw at each other to get to know the other person. Some like phenomenal and some is okay with a slow pickers! (not too slow)

That reduces our problem to a small sub problem, answer to which are simple and obvious.

## How to become better at football?

1. **Be a fair player** - That means the one that play by the rules (while taking small advantages like corner, small penalties). Have a mutual trust by people around you , that you're always fair player no matter what situations are! This means treating everyone equal and fair, not to overjudge or being biased no matter what. (Cute girl or not so cute)

2. **Be a defender** - Have an over-confidence on your internal ability to handle any goal coming through. (negativity kills!) No one able to fool or **hurt you** , no matter what! Practice it well, by being vulnerable to attacked and track your defense skills.

3. **Be an attacker** - 

   > If you don't attack -> you loose (or maximum draw)

   These are the stones, that needs to be thrown at each other to get to know more about other self. The game of scoring goals should be balance, like how you play with a younger child. If you're too much attacking, you loose! This is what happens with young boys, they over invest attention initially ( a zero sum game! )

   > Play nicely (slowly if you don't understand).
