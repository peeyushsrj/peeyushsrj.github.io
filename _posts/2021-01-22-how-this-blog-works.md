The first step for any effective growth/ development is organisation. You can find organisation everywhere, either in your home, your workplace, your managers, your project kanban etc. Organisation gives us a start and a path to walk. (walking or not is a choice subject to surroundings - see place where you [live](#))

I can remember a time where the shift happens in my life, and I can remember a journaling system. A public journal is helpful for us to become more clear and our family or generations ahead. 

### Diving it into tech 

Since working on devops for a long time, I've been practicing to automate things to the point of bare simplicity! Like just click and run - that easy! 

I have experimented with wordpress, drupal, ghost, dev.to and whatâ€™s so every , name it! Being in control makes me customize to any future requirements. 

These are common problems, and my common solutions for them.

1. Hosting problem - I want my blog to live forever with a domain name and back-end that is always there. -> Github
2. Easy deployment - I do not want to search around files and take time to re-think the whole process for deployment, when there is already drag and drop! - [Github pages powered with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
3. Framework with batteries - I want to just use RSS feed, or newsletter, or comments seamlessly. Above solution (2) still works here.

Thus I would usually write in google docs and paste into some files into my github repositroy. <br>
Bang, new blog! How fast, and efficent and natural.

*In long terms - blogging will always be positive sum game!*
