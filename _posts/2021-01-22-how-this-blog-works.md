Since working on devops for a long time, I've been practicing to automate things to the point of bare simplicity! Like just click and run - that easy! 

I have experimented with wordpress, drupal, ghost, dev.to and whatâ€™s so every , name it! Being in control makes me customize to any future requirements. 
These are common problems, and my common solutions for them.

Hosting problem - I want my blog to live forever with a domain name and back-end that is always there. - Github
Easy deployment - I do not want to search around files and take time to re-think the whole process for deployment, when there is already drag and drop! - Github pages powered with [Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
Framework with batteries - I want to just use RSS feed, or newsletter, or comments seamlessly. Above solution (2) still works here.

Thus I would usually write in google docs and paste into some files into my github repositroy. Bang, new blog! How fast, and efficent and natural.
