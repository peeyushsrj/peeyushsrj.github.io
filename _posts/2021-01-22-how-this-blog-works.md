Blog setting up should be easy and intuitive. I use Github page to do it!

Why?

1. Cloud storage for blog posts and remote edit

I use multipe devices for editing/writing. The latest code, can be edited either from online or from my local computer. I don't have to keep a 24*7 backup anywhere as it is stored totally on cloud

2. Provide a Framework for Static Site hosting (along doing it for FREE)

Github uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). After initial setup by github (for repositories cloning), keep your public files (written in markdown) using the format `YYYY-mm-dd-some-title1.md`. All the files with these conventions goes to public blog. Thus, this can also be used to store drafts.

3. Batteries Included

Since the blogging framework `jekyll` used underneath support custom plugins e.g. Newsletters, RSS feed, Comments, Social linking etc. You can select what to include and what not! It's highly flexible and made just for blogging. (Everything here is a setting!)

Why do I do blogging?

- Learning via writing
- Writing is, clearing mind
- Knowledge Sharing

<!--

The first step for any effective growth/ development is organisation. You can find organisation everywhere, either in your home, your workplace, your managers, your project kanban etc. Organisation gives us a start and a path to walk. (walking or not is a choice subject to surroundings - see place where you [live](#)) -->

<!-- I can remember a time where the shift happens in my life, and I can remember a journaling system. A public journal is helpful for us to become more clear and our family or generations ahead.  -->

<!-- ### Diving it into tech  -->

<!-- Since working on devops for a long time, I've been practicing to automate things to the point of bare simplicity! Like just click and run - that easy!  -->

<!-- I have experimented with wordpress, drupal, ghost, dev.to and whatâ€™s so every , name it! Being in control makes me customize to any future requirements.  -->
<!-- 
These are common problems, and my common solutions for them.

1. Hosting problem - I want my blog to live forever with a domain name and back-end that is always there. -> Github
2. Easy deployment - I do not want to search around files and take time to re-think the whole process for deployment, when there is already drag and drop! - [Github pages powered with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
3. Framework with batteries - I want to just use RSS feed, or newsletter, or comments seamlessly. Above solution (2) still works here.

Thus I would usually write in google docs and paste into some files into my github repositroy. <br>
Bang, new blog! How fast, and efficent and natural.

*In long terms - blogging will always be positive sum game!* -->
