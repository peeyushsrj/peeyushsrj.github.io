Ever come acrossed, situations like these ?


- Gmails stopping your email, because your local storage is full. 
- You don't want to spend per month to continue extra storage, that gmail provides.
- As for me, concerned what data they can extract from us. **Privacy Matters**
- Keeping photos, applications, notes private for security (in your pc only or max mobile with security)

So, like my elder brother was facing similar situation. He often uses gmail, but you know inbox suspends because storage is full. (And he also forgot to renew his subscription as well)

If you're facing this problem, I suggest cleaning up bigger files and stop reading further - https://drive.google.com/settings/storage
But if you want to little bit deep down the rabbit whole, and want to have these things. I say you can have it! 

- It provides you ecosystem of applications like photos, notes, bookmarks, music, openoffice docs, notes etc. Most of what you want
-  You can choose your data to be sync to all , or just push to cloud. (multiple devices needed)
- Person music server, with classic mp3 etc...
- Most important, on one's gonna peak your data ever, until hacker get hang of your personal laptop, with home wifi :) (super rare)

Enough of talking, see what is this what you want?
