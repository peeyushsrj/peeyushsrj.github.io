*This is for adults, the ones suistainining or suistanced.*

**Will you do whatever you're doing, if you know you're going to die?**

or better

**What are the things that you remember, while you're on your deathbed? Do you remember your daily work?**

Answer is certain and NO. Work was also meant for humans to connect, not to get dweled into.
Also I guess, you only remember emotions - not those mind constructs that are being bragged!

> Not the art that you have created, but emotions.

> Acceptance is the currency, which generates love and all other emotions.

### Expectations are shit! 

Awareness gone waste! This was just meant to protect us, not to become our master! But yeah, this is how the mind's protection goes. e.g. If someone is disagreeing with you, you're mind is telling you either to shut this up or I am right or I won't talk to this stupid or develop some kind of resistance.

I won't say it's bad. It's an amazing follower, it doesn' everything. And there lies the problem, where are you?
