**tldr;**  This is for busy people.

How often do you get less time after work? And do you spend remaning time on mobile as well as laptop (gaming)?

### Introduction

Internet gaves us - information, sources of entertainment, brilliance, books, connection to anyone within instant, online presence and source of income primarily. But overindulgement caused lot of problems as well - no. 1 is no time!

If you agree, then read one. This problem is not in you, but one of **generic problem of abundance**. If you have too much of everything, it goes out of control. Now,  how do we fix it? 

Remember in childhood , we have restrictions on chocolates? Same needs to be applied here as well - either it's self made or parents made! 

There are many ways to restrict it, many are personal. What I found, is following effective measure! 

### Restriction at Physical level 

Basically, switch off or keep aside your all devices which are source of information. Like your laptop, mobile etc. You can make available hours for them. Like 10-6pm!

Other time, you can keep your devices locked, send the keys to someone etc. To avoid overusage. If you need some urgent use, you can always use. But if not, you can maybe note it down on a piece of paper for upcoming day.

Now question, is If you don't have a good self control? Then comes the Software level!

### Restrictions at Software level

Well us, indeed. Our instinct always keeps us in habit, and what is the gaurtee that we don't do it ? 

 **Fred Stutzman**, also felt this way back in 2008. He as a great tech guy, as he gave us a tool to avoid overcomsumption of information. Freedom is a cross platform tool for limiting your time with session, each session has allowed and blocked sites options. Best part it works on mobile, laptop, tablet!
