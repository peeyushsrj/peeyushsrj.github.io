<!-- # Reddit Reader -->

Reddit web UI still sucks, I ended up making one. Actually, I have used GPT tool Lovable.ai rather than writing things uncessary by me. Within 2minutes, there's the site. 



You can enter any of the reddit url here, and browse just with keyboard keys `Tab` or/and `Enter` to browse/read respectively. Hit a try, easy peasy!
