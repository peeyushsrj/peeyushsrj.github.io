<p>Perhaps most cricitcal part of life!</p>

<h3 id="my-mantra-for-success">My mantra for success</h3>

<p>When you don’t want to work, Work.</p>

<p>Question is how seamless systems are.</p>

<p>Let’s dive into tech, from an analogy of a chemical reaction</p>

<h2 id="chemical-reaction">Chemical Reaction</h2>

<p>What if I told you , that we also behave like chemicals in real life. All we want to go beyond our wishes, by doing some things. (Either towards or away)</p>

<p>e.g. Working for a company, so that one can have a sustainable present and future.</p>

<p>Thus, we behave like reactants going towards products. Barriers may be high or low.</p>

<h2 id="seamless-systems">Seamless Systems</h2>

<p>Anything that helps to go towards products sides, in a seamless way is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catalyst</code>. And all the components including you (reactants) or your helpers (catalyst) and the output is what makes a seamless system.</p>

<p>I am not against working hard principle but since we are living in an abundant world (if you don’t do something someone else will do) - it’s a smart choice to choose your area.</p>

<p>If not me, @from expert</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;99% of effort is wasted. I say this because you should be very thoughtful and realize in most things (relationships, work, even in learning) what you’re trying to do is find the thing you can go all-in on to earn compound interest.&quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/naval?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@naval</a></p>&mdash; Navalism (@NavalismHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/NavalismHQ/status/1360785838989262850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>Thus rather than choosing a hard way, look for catalysts. How do you look for one?</p>

<p>Brute force/ Trial and Error</p>

<p>e.g. On demand offices are good examples for this. One can go to work when they want to do a lot of work and not when they are full. (Can do list from home etc type) Offices for me is like an area where I can focus on work most of the time. No laziness, No homesickness, Just work!</p>

<p>e.g. Another good example is to take out a colleague along with you to the office or maybe a coffee shop. The company will be partially comfortable and you can also find your peace! and yeah you can talk with him, or feel more socialized!</p>

<!--P.S. This is not my concept, I am using one of the theories told by my chemistry teacher when we were having a tough time at 11-12th standard.(Mr. Anil Sharma)-->

<!-- do all things that makes you peacful :- starting with internal, buying utililsts, staying with people, traning your mindeset, finally meaning. Because ususally it's the later one; that gives us first! (happy!) -->
