<h1>Inferiority Complex is an Illusion ?</h1>
<p class="muted small">Published on March 6, 2022</p>

<p>This world of ours – many people suffering from this. All their actions are to avoid this problem. Why? So, they’ll be attractive. In this case; one should keep asking what’s next. Because – If you dependent on expectation from someone else – you’ll fail for sure. (Based on first match probability)</p>

<p>If you want to have a relationship – you have to approach that person and show yourself. And if they reject you -&gt; then move on. Relationship is not a discounted product – It’s second most important decision in your life.</p>

<p>If you want to people to respect – you have to work on yourself; to be better human instead of expecting respect.</p>

<p><strong>Personally</strong>, I have struggled with my voice like a girl in childhood. I used to look ugly also. Now, when I overcame all of this – I realized this was mere an illusion. I can’t believe it! If you don’t believe – do it yourself. But don’t waste your life on it like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby">Gatsby</a>.</p>

<p>The only important thing in your life is you being conscious. It’s the first step of a better life with more space and time and energy. I am not saying earning money and taking care of family and other duties are not important. It’s all about leading same life with more gears!</p>

<p>Sometimes I think I should suffer also with this; because most of us still doing. That is the reason you’ll see me riding a red colour old scooty pep. (although I drive my i10 also when it is required)</p>
