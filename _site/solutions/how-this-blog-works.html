<h1>Why another blog, should you? how?</h1>
<p class="muted small">Published on January 22, 2020</p>

<p>Blog setting up should be easy and intuitive. I use Github page for better organisation and productive writing.</p>

<details open="">
<summary>Why to blogging?</summary>
<br />
  
1. Your thoughts, or selves in a timeline. Footprints.<br />
2. Clearing your mind, making goal. Small solution without meditations.<br />
3. Learning via writing (some people use, I don't)<br />
4. Reference for someone else - either journal or tech article<br />
</details>

<details>
<summary>My Blogging Flow</summary>
<br />
  
1. Edit locally in word; save to one drive; upload to github. Forever <br />
2. Central place for all blog entries. You can fast edit on cloud in case of mistake! <br />
3. Almost no time to deploy. https://github.com/peeyushsrj/peeyushsrj.github.io/issues/9 <br /> 
4. Extensible - add Newsletter, comments, social linking, developing webpages etc. <br />

<!--

The first step for any effective growth/ development is organisation. You can find organisation everywhere, either in your home, your workplace, your managers, your project kanban etc. Organisation gives us a start and a path to walk. (walking or not is a choice subject to surroundings - see place where you [live](#)) -->

<!-- I can remember a time where the shift happens in my life, and I can remember a journaling system. A public journal is helpful for us to become more clear and our family or generations ahead.  -->

<!-- ### Diving it into tech  -->

<!-- Since working on devops for a long time, I've been practicing to automate things to the point of bare simplicity! Like just click and run - that easy!  -->

<!-- I have experimented with wordpress, drupal, ghost, dev.to and whatâ€™s so every , name it! Being in control makes me customize to any future requirements.  -->
<!-- 
These are common problems, and my common solutions for them.

1. Hosting problem - I want my blog to live forever with a domain name and back-end that is always there. -> Github
2. Easy deployment - I do not want to search around files and take time to re-think the whole process for deployment, when there is already drag and drop! - [Github pages powered with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
3. Framework with batteries - I want to just use RSS feed, or newsletter, or comments seamlessly. Above solution (2) still works here.

Thus I would usually write in google docs and paste into some files into my github repositroy. <br>
Bang, new blog! How fast, and efficent and natural.

*In long terms - blogging will always be positive sum game!* -->
