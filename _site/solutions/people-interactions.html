<h1>Communication</h1>
<p class="muted small">Published on February 2, 2020</p>

<p>I have categorized all three states, that one must pertaining while 
doing communication. To make a habit, conciously doing it won’t hurt!</p>

<ul>
  <li>First Person (Ourself)</li>
  <li>Second Person (The direct party you’re talking to)</li>
  <li>Third Person (When you’re talking to muliple)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="first-person">First Person</h2>

<p>This is the ground rule, or you can say a universal truth to follow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Being self aware.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means one should also be with themself, out of anyone’s thinking or influence. 
Be grounded to yourself, and then decide. Being okay, with the step makes all other problems go away.</p>

<p>Since other opnions won’t matter, cause you’rnt attached with them.</p>

<p>Always remind, yourself whether walking or free time or in office. Being in one’s own flow, no matter who’s texting or calling or talking or any urgency or any critical failure at company! (this is the time they want your best selve, not the one with fatal error)</p>

<p>Your flow of life can break in followings -
Influcene with fear. There could be many , for e.g. this is for me!</p>
<ol>
  <li>Dog barking</li>
  <li>Talking to crush</li>
</ol>

<p>e.g. While taking to your crush, if you see yourself excited. That means you breaked from flow. 
Retry after some time, until you come with pateince. Thank god, we have an option now,
failing at phone/text rather than directly</p>

<p>If you have this, then you can control situations. I been distrubed in early days, if people ask me if i am studying. (e.g. asking 2G mobile to open yahoo.com XD)</p>

<p>That’s 100% useful, while you’re doing office work too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, no influencial thinking. Anytime!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Rest in drafts!, I am Async)</p>

<!-- ## Second Person

### Knowns - 

Be like water, say all things that comes to mind (to your friends)

Also rather than saying, use actions. 

saying sorry is weak, instead taking efforts to correct is hard.
Which impacts heart directly.

If you don't say things that you suppose, you might be stopping which was suppose to flow.

> Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the Gods made for fun.

Keeping flow open, is good for own's heart. i.e. Saying things to mouth!
Don't get me wrong. People should avaoid criticising, instead convey things in light manner.
(Yeah that means you should abuse with wrong words in a light tone to your friend)


### Unknowns - 

These are humans like us, living on another side of world. They might have different mindsets, 
different resources, different outlook for life. 

> Be Kind

All we need more in this world is love. Treat unknowns with respect and soothing words. 
Even if they are trying to shout ([Weak men shout](#)), be kind, be grounded. Understand
and help them. Being with this nature, you're inducing good atiquotes into society. 

Donating etc. 


### Third Person

To mass people, or talking to multiple people together.

I am not trained for this, as I don't get these situations much. Will update once, I am improving my model 
with mass interactions. (soon to come...) -->
